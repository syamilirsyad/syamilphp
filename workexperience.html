                <h2>SECOND IMAM AND MUAZZIN</h2>
		<P>After finished taking SMU, before go for SPM, I challenged myself to be an Imam and Bilal at Surau Nur Baidah in Muar.  Serving as a Second Imam and Bilal is both an honor and a responsibility that I hold with sincerity and devotion. This role allows me to contribute to the spiritual well-being of the congregation and to ensure that the mosque operates as a place of peace, guidance, and worship. As a Second Imam, I assist in leading prayers and providing religious guidance. This position requires a deep understanding of Islamic teachings and the ability to address the diverse needs of the congregation. As a Bilal, I have the privilege of calling the Adhan, the beautiful and powerful invitation to prayer that unites the community in worship. This role reminds me daily of the importance of discipline and punctuality in serving Allah and His creation. Through these responsibilities, I strive to inspire unity, encourage spiritual growth, and foster an atmosphere of respect and kindness within the mosque. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve in this capacity, and I pray that Allah (SWT) accepts my efforts and guides me to fulfill this trust with sincerity and excellence.</p>
